        <h3>clockTs</h3>
        <p>ClockTs is an experiment and playground for testing TypeScript in combination with a few different things I wanted to try such as the <a href="https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/" target="_blank">luxon library</a>, a custom drag&drop functionality and the localStorage API.</p>
        <p>The main focus was to have fun with it and at the same time to solve a problem I find myself having when trying to schedule a meeting with someone living in another country. You know, we are living in the XXI century and going to <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/" target="_blank">timeanddate.com</a> each time I wanted to check on the local time for my mate from Poland was too much.</p>
        <p>Anyways, so all in all you can rearrange your clocks as you please and they will stay like that as you keep adding or removing more and across visits.</p>
        <p>There are two versions, one with a local data for the cities and their timezones (a json file downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/kevinroberts/city-timezones/blob/master/data/cityMap.json" target="_blank">here</a> ) and a remote version which implements a simple REST API I also made in Typescript to serve that same json file. All the code is available on my <a href="https://github.com/roabhi/clockTs" target="_blank">Github repo</a>.</p>
