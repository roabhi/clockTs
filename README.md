A simple, visual and fun way of keep tracking different times zones made on TypeScript for the web

### About

ClockTs is an experiment and playground for testing TypeScript in combination with a few different things I wanted to try such as the [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/), a custom drag&drop functionality and the localStorage API.

The main focus was to have fun with it and at the same time to solve a problem I find myself having when trying to schedule a meeting with someone living in another country. You know, we are living in the XXI century and going to [timeanddate.com](https://www.timeanddate.com/) each time I wanted to check on the local time for my mate from Poland was too much.

Anyways, so all in all you can rearrange your clocks as you please and they will stay like that as you keep adding or removing more of them and across visits.

### Credits

Kudos to [kevin roberts](https://github.com/kevinroberts) for providing with the json file detailing I am using.

### Demo

[here is a demo](https://www.roabhi.es/clockTs). The REST service is not included in master, just the local json with all the data for the cities / timezones.


### Installation
